# JumboPack:
> A resource pack for the java edition of Minecraft that changes many sounds to those made by Jumbo on https://www.twitch.tv/jumbosale_gaming and a couple of textures too, just for fun ;)

# Pack Info:
>- This pack is created for Minecraft: Java Edition, it WILL NOT work in Bedrock Edition
>- I haven't tested it but I'm somewhat sure that this pack will be **incompatible** with any other pack that changes villager sounds. That means that if this pack is below, say: Quieter Villagers by Vanilla Tweaks, you will NOT get quieter Jumbo noises. In order to prevent this pack from being overridden by another make sure you put it at the top of your active resource packs.

# How to Install:
>- Go to releases and find the correct pack for your version of Minecraft: Java Edition
>- At the bottom of the release, click on JumbPack vX.X.X.zip to download
>- Drag and drop the JumboPack vX.X.X.zip into your resource pack folder
>- Apply the pack through the Reasource Pack menu one in game
>- And your done!
